<h3>How can I determine if I have an AMD or Intel integrated graphics processor on my system?</h3>

<p>
    The make of the integrated graphics processor should be listed in the Windows® Device Manager under Display Adapters.

    If the device is listed as Unknown or Standard VGA Controller please check with the system/motherboard manufacturer for information about the integrated graphics processor.​
